_Note that to get full marks for this, your reflection should match the "exemplary" description from the rubric:_

> The project reflection is complete and describes development and learning well, shows careful thought, highlights insights made during code development.


## 1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you?
I took more or less around 9 days. It took so long to finish my work because my computer wasn't able to run kivy, in that case, i should use JCU's computer to do my entire assignment.

## 2. What are you most satisfied with?
I'm most satisfied when i'm able to connect my main file with the kivy, because in the previous tutorial,it's quite hard and confusing for me to use kivy.

## 3. What are you least satisfied with?
I almost spend around 3 days just to understand the basic of kivy itself from the powerpoint and internet. It took me really long time to understand kivy and to make it work.

## 4. What worked well in your development process?
When i'm able to do the kivy code and understanding the logic.

## 5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?
I should be more careful, as i do a lot of stupid mistakes during the process.

## 6. Describe what resources you used and how you used them.
I use quite a lot of material to help me do this project. Powerpoint, Tutorial sheets, internet, and sometimes i ask my friend to explain me if i'm stuck at one process for a long time.

## 7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.
I think my biggest challenge that i faced doing this project is my device. Because my device cannot work well, it took really long time to do this project.
I overcome this problem by using JCU's computer and checking for some code during my time at home, then test it in the JCU's computer to see if it's work.
Other than that, i think my biggest problem is to understand kivy and the flow of this program. 
I solve it by seeing some solution from powerpoint and internet, and ask from my friend's explanation if i still cannot understand by reading the slides and source from internet.
